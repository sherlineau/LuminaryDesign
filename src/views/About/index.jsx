          <p>
            Welcome to Luminary Designs, a creative venture born from the love
            and collaboration of two incredible individuals. We are Linda and
            Sherline, a couple who have shared a journey of friendship and
            partnership for the past nine years. Our passion for technology,
            design, and the written word has led us to create Luminary Designs,
            a business where we bring our skills, experiences, and creativity to
            life.

        On the other hand, Sherline is a tech enthusiast with a degree in game
        design and development. While she aspires to forge a career in the
        gaming industry, she stands by Linda's side to support her and
        contribute her technical expertise to Luminary Designs.
